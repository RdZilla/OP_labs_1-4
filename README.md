### Date: 18.03.2023, 01.04.2023, 14.04.2023, 25.04.2023

A project on the discipline **"Optimization methods"**. The project includes 4 programs for 4 laboratory works.
- _Lab_1_: "Numerical methods of one-dimensional optimization". This program is implemented as a GUI application using the ***"Tkinter"*** library. ***"Matplotlib"***, the ***"math"*** module, was also used.
  - _The method of half division_;
  - _The method of the "golden section"_;
  - _The Fibonacci Number Method_.
- _Lab_2_: "Numerical methods of multidimensional optimization (first-order methods)". A console application without using any libraries or modules.
  - _The method of gradient descent with a constant step_.
- _Lab_3_: "Numerical methods of multidimensional optimization (second-order methods)". A console application using the ***"colorama"*** library to create colored text in the terminal.
  - _Newton's method_.
- _Lab_4_: "Numerical methods of conditional optimization". A console application using the "sympy" library for symbolic calculations.
  - _The penalty method_;
  - _Barrier function method_.

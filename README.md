### Date: 18.03.2023, 01.04.2023, 14.04.2023, 25.04.2023

A project on the discipline **"Optimization methods"**. The project includes 4 programs for 4 laboratory works.
- __Lab_1__: "Numerical methods of one-dimensional optimization". This program is implemented as a GUI application using the ***"Tkinter"*** library. ***"Matplotlib"***, the ***"math"*** module, was also used.
  - __The method of half division__;
  - __The method of the "golden section"__;
  - __The Fibonacci Number Method__.
- __Lab_2__: "Numerical methods of multidimensional optimization (first-order methods)". A console application without using any libraries or modules.
  - __The method of gradient descent with a constant step__.
- __Lab_3__: "Numerical methods of multidimensional optimization (second-order methods)". A console application using the ***"colorama"*** library to create colored text in the terminal.
  - __Newton's method__.
- __Lab_4__: "Numerical methods of conditional optimization". A console application using the "sympy" library for symbolic calculations.
  - __The penalty method__;
  - __Barrier function method__.
